          Tell us about a time when you got block on a single problem:
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          Just this week I was stuck with something I needed to complete for this sprint. I had to complete some Javascript challenges called Kata's.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          This challenge requires you to pass serveral "tests" and will complete once you pass all the test. I was going pretty well on the first kata but got stuck in the second.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          I tried some of the solving techniques I read earlier on the sprint. It took me a while but I finally figured out why I was stuck. I kind of loose focus due to several reasons.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          I was getting frustrated as I wasn't progressing as I want to be. That didn't help as my confidence was going down the longer the time I was stuck. I put pressure on myself by giving a goal to complete the challenges but with shorter timeboxes.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          I ended up taking a long break (half a day) as I just realised I was actually tired from being on the screen for a long period of time. After clearing my mind and went back at it, I found that I did better and because my mind was calm and clear I managed to proceed again.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          It still took me time but I manage to complete the challenge within timeframe.
      </p>

          Solved a problem in an elegant way.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          When I returned from clearing my thoughts and having a bit of head space from the same issue above, I actually managed to get pass one test which I was stuck for more than an hour.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          As soon as I started on the Kata again, I read the whole instructions again. I looked at the code given and the errors. I started to do pseudocode.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          I was quite suprised how easier it was because I was well rested and more focused. I didn't have the same stress and my confidence was growing as I complete more test and eventually the whole Kata.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          From this experience, I now know that I need to look after mysefl better. I just realised that I have been studying from late (10pm) at night until early morning (3 or 4am) the next day for most of the week.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          This has affected my sleeping pattern which then affected my studies due to lack of sleep.

          Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and processes:
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          Pseudocoding is one of the problem solving techniques we learnt from this sprint. It basically is an informal way of writing descriptions of a program or code without using the programming language.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          Let's think of baking a cake, it is basically you writing your own recipe and steps for how to be bake. It doesn't need to be a full on cookbook, just the important parts. So a pseudocode way will be: gather all ingredients, prepare all utensils, make the base, make the icing, bake and put together.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          Pseudocode is something I will try and practice more moving forward.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          I read about the rubber ducky method. It's not something I would do out loud though. I normally talk to myself when solving problems so you can say Im also a duck.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          My most preferred solving technique is probably relying on good old "google". I search for almost everything there when I get stuck. Sometimes I may not be lucky and not find anything related to what Im after.
      </p>
        <p className="p-tech">
          That's the time that I will go and ask for help. I normally will try and solve problems myself and give me a timeframe. If I am still stuck then I will ask for help then, either from cohorts or my facilitator.
